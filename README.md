# MusicPrediction
A basic Project to illustrate how to train and test the model using scikit-learn.


There are 3 file:
1. music.csv
2. music_prdiction.ipynb
3. music-recommender.dot


music.csv --> Dataset for the model. I have creted a very small mode, you can add up more!

music_prediction.ipynb --> Use jupyter notebook to view this. The coding part to train your music prediction model.

music-recommender.dot --> created for showing up the code in the tree form. For your VS Code, you have to download Graphviz language extension and voila, you are done!
